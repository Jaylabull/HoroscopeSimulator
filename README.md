Day 1: The basic form, where users will input their birth day information, has been updated. 

Day 2: Added CSS to first get a visual of the div elements(which will be removed later) and to stack the form where users will enter in data. 

Day 3: Updated the background for the webpage and adjusted the form padding. Trying to figure out how to add an image icon. Resources added (i.e github icon). I added it as an image but going to look into adding it as a clickable icon. 

Day 4: Added more input options. Started attmepting to incorporate a Birth Chart API. Also tweaked some CSS properties.

Day 5: Condensed CSS input properties. Still adjusting layout of form.

Day 7: Define other variables to be included on page. 

Day 8: Updated the form and Javascript to pull from zodiac drop down to generate daily horoscopes based on zodiac sign. Also changed footer links for github.
